  <h1>Professionalism</h1>

  <p>
    Professionalism will be closely monitored during the pre-clinical class meetings and field experience.
    If at any time your professionalism is questionable or deemed inadequate, points will be deducted or in the case of a serious infraction,
    you will be removed from your field experience and receive no credit (NC) and/or be in serious jeopardy of failure.
  </p>

  <h2>Candidate Disposition Alert Process:</h2>
  <p>
    The purpose of the alert process is to identify candidate performance or conduct that fails to satisfy professional expectations associated with professionalism,
    inclusivity and collaboration determined by the Department of Teacher Education and Leadership Studies (TELS) faculty as necessary standards to effectively serve all students or clients.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Candidate Performance Alert form is completed when a concern is raised about a candidate’s performance during any class, sponsored activity by the TELS,
    or during a YSU required field or clinical experience. This form may be used when a candidate engages in conduct, irrespective of its time or location,
    which raises substantial questions about the candidate’s ability to perform his or her role as an educational professional.
    The Candidate Performance Alert Form can be used by university faculty, staff, supervisors, mentor teachers, or other school personnel when they have a concern,
    other than one that can be effectively addressed through routine means of supervision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Individuals with questions regarding the process and the form should contact the Administrator of Student Field Experiences at 330.941.3735.
