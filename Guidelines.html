<p>Effective fall 2020, the following guidelines have been put in place for the safety of both the YSU teacher candidate and the students that he/she is working with. </p>
<ul>
    <li>At no time should the teacher candidate go to teacher’s home to prepare for, or teach, in the virtual environment.  Acceptable alternatives include:  the school site where the teacher is employed, YSU, or other public site (library, coffee shop, etc.).</li>
<li>Teacher candidates may work virtually either one-on-one, or with small groups in break-out rooms under the supervision of the cooperating teacher and university supervisor who will be responsible for periodic monitoring.</li>
<li>No virtual lessons may be video recorded without the permission of the teacher of record in accordance with school policy regarding video recording of students.
<li>Dress attire when teaching virtually is the same as the classroom, business casual.  Professionalism is just as important virtually as it is in person (background, noise, distractions, preparation, knowledge of use of technology).  Bottom line—be professional and be prepared.</li>
<li>As stated in the Licensure Code of Professional Conduct for Ohio Educators, “An educator responsibly creates, uses, consumes, distributes, and protects information and data across all technologies. Educators shall maintain appropriate boundaries with colleagues, students, and the school community when using technology and electronic communications.”</li></li>
<li>As stated in the Licensure Code of Professional Conduct for Ohio Educators specifically, f) Knowingly failing to report and/or address instances of electronic or online harassment, bullying or intimidation of a student.</li>

<li>Please refer to the tips, resources, and do’s and dont’s of the #ABConduct Remote Instruction PDF found at the following link: http://education.ohio.gov/Topics/Teaching/Educator-Conduct/ABConduct</li>
<li>Please report any questions or concerns immediately to your cooperating teacher and university supervisor.</li>
</ul>
