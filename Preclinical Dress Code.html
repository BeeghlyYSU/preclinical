  <h2>Preclinical Dress Code</h2>
  <h3>Teacher Candidate Dress Code for Preclinical Experience</h3>
  <p>Dress and appearance must be consistent with the high professional standards expected of all teachers. All teacher candidates are expected to adhere to the following dress code which includes cleanliness, neatness, and modesty.  Appropriate appearance and dress contribute to a positive academic environment.  Any clothing, jewelry, or personal grooming that is considered unsafe, unhealthy, or is determined to be disruptive to the educational process is prohibited.  The following is a list of guidelines to follow as a guest in the school to which you have been assigned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Consider student teaching as a job interview, dress and act accordingly</li>
<li>Stand out in a professional, positive way (appearance, behavior, professionalism)</li>
<li>Always dress professionally</li>
<li>Slacks, khakis, knee length skirts are appropriate (denim, yoga pants, and sweat pants are not allowed)</li>
<li>Blouses and collar shirts required.  Blazer, jacket, or sweater in cold weather (hoodies are not allowed)</li>
<li>Appropriate shoes (flip-flops are not allowed)</li>
<li>Accessorize appropriately, ties for male candidates if teachers are required to wear</li>
<li>Piercings should be limited to the ears</li>
<li>Tattoos must generally be covered.  Check with the cooperating teacher for additional guidance regarding tattoos.</li>
<li>Keep hair well groomed</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Exceptions to the above dress code may be made in the event of special school activities or field trips with special permission from the university supervisor.  A teacher candidate can be removed for unprofessional dress or appearance by the mentor teacher, building principal, or university supervisor.  If you are unsure of something regarding your appearance or dress, such as an unnatural hair color or style, check with the mentor teacher.<br><br>

Part of the required dress code is to wear your YSU ID throughout your entire preclinical field experience.  The ID should be visible and clear for all school personnel.  This is an issue of professionalism as well as building safety.<br><br>

Building principals, mentor teachers, and university supervisors are responsible for ensuring that teacher candidates are in compliance with the dress code.</p>

<p>Note: 
There are organizations that provide free and reduced professional apparel and consulting services for professional attire.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dress for Success</li>
    <li>Suit Yourself</li>
</ul>
