    <h1>Grading Policy</h1>

    <h2>Grading Policy:</h2>
    <p>
      Preclinical candidates will be evaluated on their performance in the preclinical field experience. Professionalism, dispositions, and overall performance in the school site are considered. Mentor teachers will evaluate candidates’ performance through observing, completing the CPAST observation form, and conferencing with the preclinical candidate. A final evaluation (CPAST and EDA) will be completed, individually, by the mentor teacher and university supervisor. As part of the evaluation, the mentor teacher and university supervisor will determine if they recommend the candidate to move to the student teaching experience. Passage for a preclinical candidate on the CPAST is an average of 1.5 and EDA is an average of 1.25 with no zeros.
    </p>
    <p>
      Candidates not recommended for the student teaching experience may be required to satisfactorily complete TCED 5888D which includes an additional field experience before entering student teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionalism will be closely monitored during the preclinical class meetings and field experience. If at any time professionalism is questionable or deemed inadequate, points will be deducted or in the case of a serious infraction, a candidate will be removed from the preclinical experience and receive no credit (NC) and/or be in serious jeopardy of failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      A student can’t fail the same course two times and be allowed to take it a third time.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight-red">
      • If a student fails the same course two times, the student is done with the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      A student may not fail more than 3 courses in BOTH pre-clinical courses.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight-red">
      • If a student fails more than 3 courses (includes repeat failures), the student will not be permitted to continue with the program.
    </p>

    <h2>Critical Tasks:</h2>
    <p>
      Critical Tasks are performance-based assignments that reflect a candidate’s knowledge, skills and/or dispositions aligned with the standards for teacher preparation of the licensure area. These tasks assess a candidate’s ability to move through the teacher preparation program in an effective way, meeting and/or exceeding expectations in these professional standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      • Therefore, critical tasks must be passed in content courses to pass a course but not the assessment or differentiation courses. Failure to effectively pass the critical task(s) will result in remediation through repetition of the course to guarantee that all teacher candidates are prepared to be an effective educator once they leave Youngstown State University. Critical Tasks are submitted on TaskStream.
