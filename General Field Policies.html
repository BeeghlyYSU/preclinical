  <h1>General Field Policies</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Teacher candidates are <span class="red-text">NOT PERMITTED</span> to request or secure their own preclinical placements.</strong>
      A field placement will be made for you by the Preclinical Coordinator. Placements are made within 40 minutes or 40 miles from the address identified on your preclinical application.
    </li>

    <li>
      Teacher candidates may not request reassignment of any field placement under any circumstances. Placements are based on several factors which reassignment could negatively impact. Candidates are to report substantial concerns with a field placement to the Office of Student Field Experiences. Concerns will be reviewed and if applicable, written notification will be provided to the teacher candidate.
    </li>

    <li>
      Teacher candidates are not permitted to complete field experiences in the school district from which they graduated. TELS policy prohibits placement of a candidate where he or she completed his or her K–12 education whenever an alternative placement is available. This policy has been established to ensure teacher candidates receive a fair and unbiased evaluation of their performance.
    </li>

    <li>
      If a placement is made, and later deemed inappropriate for the candidate’s content and/or licensure area, a new placement will be secured by the Office of Student Field Experiences.
    </li>

    <li>
      Candidates seeking accommodations for a disability are required to meet with Accessibility Services to discuss if accommodations are applicable to the field experience. If so, the candidate will be required to obtain a letter from Accessibility Services identifying the accommodation(s) required and provide the letter to the Administrator of Student Field Experiences a minimum of 4 weeks prior to the start of the field experience.
    </li>

    <li>
      Candidates are not to be involved in social networking with district students outside of educational purposes. Candidates involved in any social networking with district students will be removed from the field experience and may be removed from the teacher preparation program. Candidates need to be aware that further actions from the district may occur.
    </li>
  </ul>
