          <h2>Policies During the Preclinical Experience</h2>
          <p>The Department of Teacher Education and Leadership Studies (TELS) is pleased to have the opportunity to place teacher candidates in elementary and secondary schools as guests for the preclinical experience, and we support the following operational rules as guidelines for teacher candidates:</p><br>
          <ol>
            <li>Teacher candidates are to maintain a high level of professional dress, confidentiality, and professionalism at all times and with all individuals involved with the preclinical experience. If a teacher candidate’s behavior and/or actions are deemed unethical and/or unprofessional, the teacher candidate may be removed from the preclinical experience and/or receive a Candidate Alert form. </li><br>
<li>School Polices may vary from school to school. Teacher candidates may be familiar with the policies of one school; this does not mean they are also familiar with the policies of their new preclinical site. Upon arriving at the school assignment, the teacher candidate should immediately become familiar with the school policies, regulations, and physical facilities of that school.</li><br>
<ul>
    <li>Failure of the teacher candidate to comply with school policies and regulations may result in the removal from the preclinical and further action from the district.</li><br>
</ul>
<li>Teacher candidates are guests in the school district and should act accordingly. Final authority in the classroom rests with the Mentor Teacher. If a teacher candidate engages in conduct, irrespective of its time or location, which raises substantial questions about the candidate’s ability to perform his/her roles as an educational professional, the Mentor Teacher, University Supervisor, and/or other school personnel may file a Candidate Performance Alert Form and/or the district may request the teacher candidate’s removal.</li><br>
<li> The Department of Teacher Education and Leadership Studies does not approve of a teacher candidate being used as a substitute teacher. In the event of the Mentor Teacher’s absence, the Teacher Candidate may teach in the assigned classroom, but a substitute teacher should be present. The building principal assumes the responsibility if no substitute is available. Any problems or questions arising in this area should be forwarded to the Preclinical Coordinator.</li><br>
<li>The time commitment for pre-clinical begins with the regular university schedule and continues with designated pre-clinical hours determined by both university requirements as well as the needs of the school to which teacher candidates are assigned. Candidates may not miss campus hours to attend special field events.</li><br>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Attendance is mandatory. Pre-clinical candidates are not permitted to leave the building during preclinical hours without permission from the mentor teacher and university supervisor.</li><br>
    <li>In the event a teacher candidate must call off or arrive late, the candidate is to:</li><br>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>Contact the mentor teacher and provide the reason for the absence or tardiness.</li><br>
    <li>Call the school secretary; identify yourself by stating your name, your mentor teacher’s name, and the reason for your tardiness or absence.</li><br>
<li>Email the respective faculty and state name, preclinical school, and mentor teacher. Give the reason for your absence. (You must bring a doctor’s excuse or proof of funeral attendance when you return, so you will not be penalized)</li><br>
<li>Complete the absentee form and submit it to the respective faculty within two days of being absent.</li><br>
<li>Make up any missed field days/hours (REQUIRED)</li><br>
</ul>
<li>Teacher candidates are prohibited from cell phone and personal electronic device usage during the school’s regularly scheduled instructional periods.  Exceptions to this policy are for educational purposes only and the mentor teacher has provided written approval.  Teacher candidates using a cell phone and/or personal electronic devices during instructional periods may be removed from the preclinical experience.</li>          <br>
<ul>
    <li>In the case of a personal emergency situation, inform the mentor teacher and put the cell phone on vibrate. </li><br>
    <li>Calls for family emergencies are to be handled through the school office. Make sure your family has the school number. (This is an established policy in most schools.)</li><br>
</ul>
<li>In the event that the school to which the teacher candidate is assigned is subject to a jurisdictional dispute between a teachers' association and the school corporation, teacher candidates will assume a position of neutrality. The teacher candidate is to remain away from the assignment and not participate in either side of the dispute. The Teacher Candidate may be reassigned as necessary.</li><br>
</ol>
<p>NOTE: Teacher Candidates removed from the preclinical experience may appeal the removal.  Contact the Administrator Student Field Experiences to discuss the appeal process which needs to begin within 24 hours of the removal.</p><br>
<h3>Placement requirements for preclinical teacher candidates:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Sign in and out of the school office on the days you attend the field experience.</li>

<li>Monitor your personal language, dress, and deportment.</li>
<li>Participate in all school activities to which you are invited.</li>
<li>Maintain confidentiality concerning students, parents, and mentor teachers, as well as discussing concerns only with persons directly involved.</li>
<li>Remedy a problem that may arise by contacting the necessary faculty members in a timely fashion</li>
<li>Stay out of faculty lounges, unless the principal personally invites the pre-clinical candidates in the school to utilize the facility</li>
<li>Accept responsibility for your academic and personal performance.</li>
<li>Be on time and ready to begin daily lessons.</li>
<li>Submitting all required assignments on time.</li>

<li>Accept constructive criticism.</li>
<li>Display and convey a positive attitude about YSU and the specific school district that the teacher candidate is placed in during the duration of the semester. At no time may the teacher candidate express negative comments about YSU or the participating school district to other staff members, teacher candidates, parents, and/or students.</li>
<li>Any candidate having a physical and/or medical condition that may hamper your performance in the classroom needs to see the pre-clinical coordinator privately. This would be information that would have to be filed with a principal or district.</li>
</ol><br>

<h3>Professional and Ethical Conduct Notification:</h3>
<p>Candidates are to conduct themselves in a manner that will not compromise their ability to be effective in any field placement.  The professional code of ethics for teachers extends beyond the classroom into the community and demands careful and wise decision-making.  Therefore, candidates must maintain a high level of professional dress, confidentiality, and professionalism at all times and with all individuals involved in the preclinical field experiences.  At any time during the preclinical experience, a candidate can be removed from the preclinical field experience for behavior(s) and/or actions deemed unethical and/or unprofessional by the mentor teacher, university supervisor, building principal and/or the Administrator of Student Field Experiences.  Candidates can appeal their removal through the Office of Student Field Experiences.</p>
       
<h3>Social Media Notification:</h3>
<p>
    As you complete your TELS program(s), understand that you are a direct reflection of Youngstown State University and represent the TELS students, faculty, and staff on campus, in school districts, and within the community.  Therefore, always maintain a high level of professionalism.  Unprofessional behavior can lead to removal from the TELS program, revoke or denial of a teaching license, and/or loss of employment.<br>
<br>
You need to be aware that any and all of your social media profile(s), networking, and usage may be viewed by YSU, schools, and community even if you use a different name, images and videos, and/or recognizable personal information.  When concerns with your social media are identified, it will be at the judgement of your respective program faculty to determine if you are demonstrating inappropriate and/or unprofessional conduct, action to be taken, and the extent of your continuation within any of the TELS education programs and/or respective program(s) field experiences.  You may appeal the decision to the Upper Division Admission and Retention Committee.  (This notification encompasses your enrollment from the start to finish of a TELS education program.) <br>
<br>
During any field experience, further actions from the district may occur to include notification to ODE.  Review the Licensure Code of Professional Conduct for Ohio Educators. <br>
